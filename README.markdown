# Circuit Design
Without sufficient access to a scope and convenient design and simulation 
suites I decided to make due with the tools I know and love :wink:.

## Toolkit
For the design process I have used the following tools:
 - MacSpice 3f5
 - Octave 3.8.

## Algorithm
 - Determine range, by making a full rotation
 - Note the apexes ($V\_max$ and $V\_min$ for both signals)
 - Translate acquired data to degree
